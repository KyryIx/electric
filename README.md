# Electric
Code to help with solutions to electric area. Now exists three examples with codes:

- [equation2wave](./equation2wave/) to generate audio wave format using the math expression. The files are written in JavaScript and there are comments to help you to modify for your purposes.<br/>![equation2wave_example](equation2wave/img/example_2_1.png)<br/>The figure can see using the [Audicity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).
- [generateSignalToHantek2D42](./generateSignalToHantek2D42/) to generate data to upload in **[Hantek2D42](http://hantek.com/products/detail/13174)**. The Hantek 2D42 has a signal generator that it can load CSV file and get signal. The code here generated, you write your math expressions and the application generate to signal data to equipment.<br/>![principal_window](./generateSignalToHantek2D42/img/window.png)<br/>Window to generate signal using math expression.
- [convertFLD2CSVtoYOKOGAWA](./convertFLD2CSVtoYOKOGAWA/) to convert FLD file generate in [Yokogawa DL850E](https://www.yokogawa.com.br/produtos/teste-e-medicao/oscilloscopes/dl850edl850ev-scopecorder) to CSV where you can work in excell and other app.
